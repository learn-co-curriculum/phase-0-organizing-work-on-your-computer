# Organizing Your Work for this Course

## Learning Goals

- Configure a directory for storing lessons
- Understand the relationship between navigating directories in the terminal and
  navigating directories in a graphical user interface like Finder
- Practice common terminal commands such as `pwd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, and `cd`

## Instructions

From now on, you'll be executing code on your own computer. For each and every
lab, you'll be copying the code to your computer using
[Git](https://git-scm.com). You will then be able to run and test your code in
your terminal, and submit your work using the learn-co gem.

## Creating Folders to Organize Your Work

- Go to your terminal and navigate to your home directory by typing `cd ~`
- Navigate into the `Development` folder with `cd Development` (if you don't
  have a `Development` folder yet, you can create it with `mkdir Development`,
  then `cd` into it)
- Create a directory for all your assignments by typing `mkdir code`
- Navigate into this folder with `cd code`
- In here, create a directory for the prework with `mkdir prework`

You'll be going through multiple phases in this course, so it may be helpful
to go one step further and also create folders for phases 1 through 5 within
`code`.

Having a specific place for your work will make it easier to find if you ever
need to look back at an earlier project. It'll also keep the rest of your
computer's folders clear of random code.
